You can download the data associated with the CO<sub>2</sub> emission plot using the link provided above (when accessing each URL, go to menu item _download_ right below the visualization plot).\n",

    "2. Create two scatter plots: One showing annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vs. mean temperature and the second showing annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vs. precipitation.\n",
    "3. Fit linear regression models to the data used in the scatter plots (e.g., using the [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)) and add the two resulting regression lines to both scatter plots from the previous part of this task.\n",
    "4. Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient for the measurements used in both scatter plots respectively and explain your result briefly.\n",
    "5. Explain in your own words the following factors that have to be considered when interpreting a correlation coefficient: (A) non-linear relationship, (B) outliers, and (C) correlation vs. causality."

For the smoothing procedure, choose a method and window size $n$ that makes most sense to you. Explain and evaluate your choice briefly.\n",
    "3. Using appropriate statistics, analyze both time series to look for the following: (A) trend, (B) cyclic variation, and (C) cross correlations. For each feature, explain what the analysis has shown.\n",
    "4. Revisit your first hypotheses from Task 3.1 and interpret all findings from Task 3.2 and Task 3.3 in the light of your first ideas. How has your first impression changed? What have you been able to show through your analysis? What do the results mean in terms of predictive power?      "
