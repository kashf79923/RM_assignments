    "\n",
    "   Target: Adults aged 18-35.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Exclude: Individuals with pre-existing severe mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders) that require clinical intervention or active treatment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Step 3: Administration of the Questionnaire<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. My chosen method is: Use tools like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, etc. to easily share and collect responses. However, this approach makes it really hard to control the input. Also, it is necessary to collect response from different parts of the world, rather than just one country. Otherwise, it would be easily to be obscured by confound factors like social circumstances or family dynamics. IAS classmates come from different countries with different backgrounds, we can ask the classmates to help gather some respondants for our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For this study, we do not do experiments on participants. Usually, we would devide them into 2 groups, one uses the social media heavily and one only uses for a tiny bit of time. But that does not seem very ethical to do, because it may cause harm. So for this study we would just collect response from different group of people. Through the pilot study, we can improve the questionnaire's instructions or questions.\n",

    "2. Assess Validity:\n",
    "    - Content Validity: Ensure that the questions cover all aspects of the constructs we intend to measure. Was there any possible confounds?\n",
