The outcome of task 1 should be a questionnaire with at least 6 questions.\n",

Use appropriate visualizations to support conclusions and discuss their implications.\n",

This section should include the most relevant information about your study, i.e., a summary of the conducted experiment, the data collection process, the relevant statistics, the testing procedure(s), and your findings concerning the research question(s). **We are not looking for a full paper, just the last section!**<br>\n",
